About me
    Hello, I’m Aldo, full-stack developer with a solid background in electronics engineering, computer science teaching, math teaching, and cryptocurrency trading.

    I studied to broaden my software developer aptitudes at a fantastic school called Microverse, where I pair-programmed with partners from all over the world. I’m a teamwork fan! I love coding, that's why I’m very proud of my career at Microverse, where I’m best at coding challenges, and I’m behind every detail of a coding project. Apart from HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript, I master React/Redux, Ruby, Rails, Devise gem, Rspec, Jest, Git, Github, Postgres SQL, and always learning.

    I've been working with disabled people, teaching them computer science, and making computer adaptations (hardware and software), in particular speech recognition. This project stemmed from the final project, as I graduated from the best Engineering University in Argentina. These experiences make me a specialist in UX, UI, and accessibility.

    I've been also supervising a line where we build medical equipment such as incubators. I also worked at a company that did CCTV and I was in charge of the computers that centralized the recordings, and programmed applications in VB.net and JavaScript ES6. I also have knowledge of C#, and C++.

    I'm now in the cryptocurrency market, where I see strong opportunities for development.
